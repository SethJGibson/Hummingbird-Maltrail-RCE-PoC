# Hummingbird
A PoC exploit for Maltrail v0.53, written as part of my participation in HTB Sau box. This script sends POST request data to a server hosting RCE-vulnerable Maltrail v0.53, set with a python3 reverse shell that will be executed once received on the server. Before execution, be sure to set up a Netcat listener on the same port you run the script with.

# Why the odd title?
I'm trying to make a habit of naming my projects after whichever song I'm enjoying the most at the start, as a way to timestamp them. This one is based off the recent bop by Metro Boomin and James Blake. [Give it a listen!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TENzstSjsus&ab_channel=MetroBoominVEVO)
